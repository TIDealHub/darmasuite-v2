# Darma Cash Project: Secure, Private DAG Blockchain with Smart Contracts

## ABOUT DARMA CASH PROJECT
Darma Cash Project (DMCH) is the cutting-edge of a new generation of anonymous blockchain based on Monero (XMR). DMCH adopts the Block Dag block ledger with PPoS and integrates private addresses, concealed financial data, masked identities, traceless IP, private smart contracts and DeFi/DEX on the privacy framework of Monero. The goal of the DMCH project is to establish a decentralized distributed privacy community ecosystem on top of the DMCH public chain; DMCH introduced the core concept of Pool Pos (PPoS), which means decentralized PoS without node restrictions aiming to realize a high-speed private global SDWAN through the expansion of PPoS nodes. DMCH is not only crypto currency but also a decentralized private Internet.

## ABOUT DARMA CASH PROJECT V2
Darma Cash Project v2 is the next generation of Darma Cash Project v1. Consensus algorithm is PoW+PPoS(We call the decentralized PoS without node restrictions Pool PoS, or PPoS) based on original cryptonight. Darma Cash Project is industry leading blockchain to have bulletproofs, TLS encrypted Network. PPoS and smart contracts will be launched in this version.

### Darma Cash Project blockchain has the following features:
 - DAG Based: No orphan blocks, No soft-forks.
 - 15 Second Block time.
 - Default Fee: 0.01 DMCH/KB
 - PPoS hard-fork height: 40320, then we can register staking pools and buy shares
 - PPoS initial voting height: 120320, then we gain profits
 - WASM smart contracts(TestNet). 

### PPoS HowTo
For more detailed instructions on PPoS, see [Darma Cash Project PPoS Tutorial](https://github.com/darmaproject/wiki/blob/master/dpos.md)

### Darma Cash Project DAG
Darma Cash Project DAG implementation builds outs a main chain from the DAG network of blocks which refers to main blocks (100% reward) and side blocks (10% rewards). Side blocks contribute to chain PoW security and thus traditional 51% attacks are not possible on Darma Cash network. If Darma Cash network finds another block at the same height, instead of choosing one, Darma Cash include both blocks. Thus, rendering the 51% attack futile.
